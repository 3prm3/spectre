[Chrome Music Lab](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com) is a collection of experiments for exploring how music works, all built with the Web Audio API.

## ABOUT

The experiments were developed by different musician/programmers, so they use a variety of libraries and techniques. We post them here as inspiration and reference for anyone who wants to create their own music and sound projects in the browser.

Consult the README in each experiment's folder for more information on building and running that experiment.
