## ABOUT

Music is for everyone. So this year, for Music In Our Schools month, we wanted to make learning music a bit more accessible to everyone by using technology that’s open to everyone: the web. [Chrome Music Lab](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com) is a set of experiments that let anyone, of any age, explore how music works, all built with the Web Audio API.

We’re sharing open-source code here so that others can build new experiments based on what we’ve started. The experiments were developed by different musicians and coders, so they use a variety of libraries and techniques – WebRTC, Tone.js, and more. We hope they’re useful as inspiration or reference for anyone who wants to create their own music projects on the web.

Consult the README in each experiment's folder for more information on building and running that experiment.
